Updated September 6th,2024We appreciate your interest in the graduate program in the Department of Computer Science & Engineering at UC San Diego. We offer PhD and MS degrees in both computer science and computer engineering. We also have a streamlined 5-year BS/MS program for highly qualified UCSD CSE undergraduates. Undocumented students are welcome to apply.The UCSD Application for Graduate Admission opens for Fall 2025 admission from September 4, 2024 until December 18, 2024 at 11:59 p.m. PST. Admission is given for Fall quarter only. We do not admit new students in Spring quarters. All application materials must be submitted through the online application.The GRE is not required for PhD and MS applications for Fall 2025. Applicants may still submit valid scores if they have already taken the test.The TOEFL iBT Special Home Edition will be accepted for admission at both the Master's and PhD levels. However, the TOEFL ITP Plus for China Solution cannot be used to substitute for a standard TOEFL iBT test. The Department will also now accept IELTS scores to verify English language proficiency.For information about the online application and required supplemental documents, please refer to: Application Checklist and Guidelines.Admission to the CSE graduate program is very selective. Our department receives over 6,000 applications annually. (For Grad Data, please click here).We seek applicants with a strong academic background in computer science and engineering and/or a related field and a demonstrated potential for success in graduate school. Each application undergoes a comprehensive review by the CSE Admissions Committee, which examines every component of the application and supplemental materials when considering an applicant for admission. (Standardized test scores and grade point averages (GPA) are an integral part of the evaluation process, but admissions decisions are NOT made based on these components alone.)The MS and PhD degree programs are mutually independent. You may only apply for one program or the other; applications for both the MS and PhD programs will not be accepted. (An MS degree is not required for admission to the PhD program.)Current or former UCSD students in the MS program who wish to continue/transfer to the PhD program, will complete the UCSD Application for Graduate Admission by the general application deadline for the year they are seeking admission (Admission is ONLY given in the Fall quarters.) The application will be reviewed along with those of the external PhD applicants for that admissions cycle. MS to PhD students must complete their application online, but will NOT be able to "submit" the application. Once you have completed your online application, please email csegradinfo-phd@ucsd.edu to notify the team, so we can track your application. When sending an email, please include "MS to PhD Transfer Application Submission", in the subject line. For a complete list of all of the supplemental materials required for the graduate application, please visit our Graduate Application Checklist.If you are interested in enrolling in Computer Science and Engineering classes without being matriculated in a degree program you may do so through the Concurrent Enrollment Program.The CSE department has a limited number of application fee waivers available for PhD international students. Our department will be granting these waivers to students based on factors that include: contributions to diversity; social justice experience; overcoming adversity. Unfortunately, we are not able to grant application fee waivers on the basis of financial need alone. If you would like to request a CSE department fee waiver, please fill out the Fee Waiver Application. (Please note if applying for a fee waiver you must submit your application early at least 2 weeks early. )To be considered for admission, applicants must meet the minimum university and departmental requirements outlined below.
